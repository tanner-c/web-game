# ThreeJS Game Engine

Simple game engine built in ThreeJS. Currently implementing the following features:

**[Demo](https://tanner-c.github.io/web-game/)**

* Input Handling
* Entity Management
* Rendering
* Physics Simulation

This project demonstrates the following competencies:

- Three.js WebGPU renderer setup with responsive resize handling
- Animation loop management and scene/camera rendering
- Perspective camera configuration and OrbitControls integration
- Input handling scaffold capturing mouse position and delta
- Scene graph basics: geometry, materials, meshes, and lighting
- Modular engine architecture with configurable options (Engine, InputManager)
- GUI scaffolding via lil-gui for future runtime controls

Notes
- Physics is listed in planned features but not yet implemented in code.
